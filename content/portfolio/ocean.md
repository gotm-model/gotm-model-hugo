These six test cases have been designed such that various GOTM features 
in terms of realistic external forcing are included. 
[FLEX](/cases/flex/) is a classical 
open shelf sea scenario showing the development 
of a thermal surface mixed layer due to spring warming during about two
months. Tides and wind forcing are included.
[Gotland Deep](/cases/gotland_deep/) is a multi-annual 
non-tidal scenario for the Central Baltic Sea, including the development
of a summer thermocline overlaying a permanent halocline. 
The [Liverpool Bay](/cases/liverpool_bay/) scenario is driven by tides 
overlaid by estimated horizontal gradients of temperature and salinity,
resulting in tidal straining.
Besides temperature, salinity and velocity, 
observed dissipation rates are read in. 
The two Northern North Sea scenarios show the erosion
of the thermocline during autumn ([Northern NS (Seasonal)](/cases/northern_ns_seasonal/)), 
including observations of
temperature, salinity and dissipation rate and a complete annual cycle 
which gives an ideal base for studying shelf sea ecosystem dynamics
([Northern NS (Annual)](/cases/northern_ns_annual/)).
Finally, [OWS Papa](/cases/ows_papa/) is a real open ocean scenario
representing the conditions at the Ocean Weather Ship (OWS) Papa station in the
Northern Pacific Ocean.
