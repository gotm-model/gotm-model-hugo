The observations for this scenario have been carried out by 
[Rippeth et al (2001}](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0485\(2001\)031%3C2458:TCOTDI%3E2.0.CO%3B2)
in the** Liverpool Bay ROFI** on July 5 and 6, 1999 at a position of 53 deg 
28.4'N, 3 deg 39.2'W. The dissipation rate measurements were carried out with a 
FLY shear probe mounted on a free-falling profiler. Sensors for temperature and 
conductivity attached to the profiler give detailed information on the vertical 
density distribution during each cast. Nearby, an ADCP was mounted on the 
bottom, giving information on the vertical velocity structure. Some 
accompanying CTD casts were made in order to achieve estimates for the 
horizontal gradients of temperature and salinity. The surface fluxes are 
calculated externally by means of bulk formulae of 
[Kondo (1975)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00232256)
, where the sea 
surface temperature from measurements (FLY profiler) has been used. The bed 
roughness has been estimated from near-bed ADCP measurements as z0 = 0.0025 m 
by means of fits to the law of the wall. The external pressure gradient due to 
surface slopes is estimated according to a method suggested by 
[Burchard (1999)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X99000086)
by means 
of adjustment to near bed velocity observations. The horizontal salinity and 
temperature gradients for a typical summer situation are prescribed. The 
observations and model results show a clear SIPS (Strain-Induced Periodic 
Stratification) cycle with mixed conditions after flood (at high water) and 
stratified conditions after ebb (low water). The numerical simulations of this 
scenario have been described in 
[Simpson et al. (2002)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278434302000250).
