Hans Burchard wants to revive the list of publications where GOTM has played a significant role.

In order to succeed authors will have to provide Bibtex information for publications. So - please - provide information and inform colleagues with GOTM publications about this initiative. 

We will then add these to the list and update the website accordingly.

[Present (early 2026) - incomplete - list of publications](/html/gotm_pub.html)


The list also contains a number of publications where GOTM was used in lake mode. The lake code is no longer maintained (as of around 2018) and not part of the main repository. The old version is still usable and is available as is. 

An alternative for lake modelling is [simstrat](https://www.eawag.ch/en/department/surf/projects/simstrat/).
