# Glossary of Terms

## A

**Absolute Salinity (SA)**: True mass fraction of dissolved material in seawater (g/kg). Accounts for spatial variations in composition. See TEOS-10.

**Albedo**: Fraction of incident solar radiation reflected from a surface (dimensionless, 0-1).

**Adiabatic**: Process occurring without heat exchange with surroundings.

## B

**Barotropic**: Depth-independent; related to external pressure gradients from sea surface slope.

**Baroclinic**: Depth-dependent; related to internal pressure gradients from density variations.

**Buoyancy Frequency (N²)**: Measure of stratification strength; N² = -g/ρ₀ ∂ρ/∂z.

## C

**Conservative Temperature (Θ)**: TEOS-10 temperature variable proportional to potential enthalpy. Better conserved under mixing than potential temperature.

**COARE**: Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment; bulk flux algorithm.

**Coriolis Parameter (f)**: 2Ω sin(φ), where Ω is Earth's rotation rate and φ is latitude.

## D

**Dissipation Rate (ε)**: Rate of turbulent kinetic energy conversion to heat through viscous forces (m²/s³).

**Drag Coefficient (Cd)**: Dimensionless coefficient relating wind stress to wind speed squared.

## E

**Eddy Diffusivity (κₜ)**: Turbulent diffusion coefficient for scalars (m²/s).

**Eddy Viscosity (νₜ)**: Turbulent viscosity for momentum (m²/s).

**EOS**: Equation of State; relates density to temperature, salinity, and pressure.

## F

**FABM**: Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models.

**Friction Velocity (u*)**: Velocity scale for turbulence; u* = √(τ/ρ₀).

## G

**GLS**: Generic Length Scale; framework unifying k-ε, k-ω, and Mellor-Yamada models.

## H

**Hydrostatic**: Assumption that vertical pressure gradient is balanced by gravity; ∂p/∂z = -ρg.

## K

**KPP**: K-Profile Parameterization; boundary layer turbulence scheme.

## L

**Latent Heat Flux**: Energy exchange due to evaporation/condensation (W/m²).

**Longwave Radiation**: Infrared thermal radiation (W/m²).

**Mellor-Yamada**: Family of turbulence closure models (MY2.5, MY2, etc.).

## P

**Patankar Scheme**: Numerical method ensuring positivity of production-destruction equations.

**Potential Temperature (θ)**: Temperature a water parcel would have if moved adiabatically to surface.

**Practical Salinity (SP)**: Dimensionless salinity based on conductivity ratio (PSS-78).

## R

**RANS**: Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations.

**Reynolds Number (Re)**: Ratio of inertial to viscous forces.

**Richardson Number (Ri)**: Ratio of stratification to shear; Ri = N²/S².
