How to read the documentation</A>
</H2>
This document is the official scientific documentation of GOTM. Due to
the fast and continuing evolution of GOTM, we have been looking for a
new and flexible way of giving a comprehensive and up-to-date
documentation for GOTM. We decided for the following strategy.

<P>
Every module of GOTM is accompanied by an introductory text on the
general theory of the subject, including mathematical derivations,
bibliographic references, and the definition of the most important
variables. These introductory parts, which should give the reader a
brief theoretical overview of what is coded in the modules, are
expected to be relatively stable. References are given to more
comprehensive introductory or advanced media for each subject.

<P>
For the actual documentation of the FORTRAN95 code, which is more
likely subject to frequent changes and extensions, a different
strategy has been followed. For every <TT>module</TT>, internal or
external <TT>subroutine</TT> or <TT>function</TT>, a short piece of
documentation in <SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN> has been directly written into the
code. These fragments of the documentation will be updated every time
the code changes. We use a software called PROTEX, which looks into
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">every</SPAN> FORTRAN file of GOTM, extracts the <SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN> parts, and
compiles some information about the FORTRAN interfaces, public member
functions, public data members, defined parameters, etc. All these
pieces of information are assembled by PROTEX to yield a nice
documentation including table of contents, figures, tables,
references, and formulae for each part of the program. The largest
part of the report has been created in this way. Note that PROTEX
looks for certain key words in the FORTRAN code to organise the
structure of the final document. Therefore, don't be confused if you
find things like <TT>!DESCRIPTION:</TT>, <TT>!INTERFACE:</TT>, <TT>!PUBLIC
DATA MEMBERS:</TT>, etc, in the FORTRAN files. These are always preceded
by an exclamation mark, and thus invisible for your FORTRAN compiler.

<P>
If you are new to GOTM, we recommend to completely go through the core
parts of GOTM described in section <A HREF="node7.html#sec:mainIntro">2</A>, section <A HREF="node15.html#sec:meanflowIntro">3</A>,
and section <A HREF="node36.html#sec:turbulenceIntro">4</A>. In these sections, you will find also
references to the relevant introductory literature. The other
parts of this documentation should be used like an encyclopedia: you
can look up things fast when you need more information about parts
of the program. Extra comments can be found in the form of standard
FORTRAN comments that should help users to find their way through the
lines of the code.

<P>
A special status in this documentation has section <A HREF="node227.html#sec:cases">12</A>
illustrating particular scenarios prepared for GOTM. This section contains
useful information about the theoretical background and the
implementation of each scenario currently available in GOTM. Scenarios
range from simple test cases, like a turbulent Couette flow, to full
oceanic applications including meteorological forcing and comparison
to measured data. The most simple scenarios descibed in section <A HREF="node227.html#sec:cases">12</A>
serve as a little tutorial, in which the key algorithms of
GOTM are introduced in a practical way.

<P>
This documentation does not contain information about how to download,
compile and run the code and the test cases. All information necessary
to run GOTM on a number of well-known platforms is compiled at <TT>www.gotm.net</TT>. If you wish to directly contact to the GOTM developers,
please write an e-mail to <TT>gotm-devel@googlegroups.com</TT>. All users 
of GOTM, who signed up on the GOTM web page, will be on the users' mailing
list, <TT>gotm-users@googlegroups.com</TT>. Information about updates, 
bug fixes, and new versions of GOTM are communicated via this list.

<P>
