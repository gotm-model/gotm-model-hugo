What is GOTM?</A>
</H2>
GOTM is the abbreviation for `General Ocean Turbulence Model'. It is a
one-dimensional water column model for the most important hydrodynamic
and thermodynamic processes related to vertical mixing in natural
waters. In addition, it has been designed such that it can easily be
coupled to 3-D circulation models, and used as a module for the
computation of vertical turbulent mixing. The core of the model
computes solutions for the one-dimensional versions of the transport
equations of momentum, salt and heat. The key component in solving
these equations is the model for the turbulent fluxes of these
quantities. The strength of GOTM is the vast number of well-tested
turbulence models that have been implemented in the code. These models
span the range from simple prescribed expressions for the turbulent
diffusivities up to complex Reynolds-stress models with several
differential transport equations to solve. Even though, evidently, not
all turbulence models published in oceanography could be implemented,
at least one member of every relevant model family can be found in
GOTM (empirical models, energy models, two-equation models, Algebraic
Stress Models, K-profile parameterisations, etc).

<P>
Besides the classic combination of the hydrodynamic and turbulent part
of the model, GOTM has been growing considerably with the years, and
new parts have been developed. Sediment transport and the dynamics of
sea grass have been added, state-of-the-art numerical schemes have
been implemented, and an environment for the assimilation of data and
the computation of atmosphere-ocean interactions exists now. In
addition, there is a number of scientific research groups that adopted
GOTM for their own projects. Even though the modules developed by
these groups (biological and bio-geochemical components, air-sea
interaction modules, plotting routines, etc) are not part of the core
structure of GOTM, as downloadable from our web-site at <TT>www.gotm.net</TT>, they are in most cases available directly from these
groups. In that sense, GOTM is an integrated, community based software
environment for an almost unlimited range of applications in
geophysical turbulence modelling.
