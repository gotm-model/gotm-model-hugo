The idea behind GOTM</A>
</H2>
Computer codes similar to pieces of GOTM can be found at many
scientific institutions. However, different researchers have different
goals. Some are interested in the development of turbulence models,
others in oceanic applications of these models, and yet others want to
compare the effects of different turbulence models on different
processes in the ocean or in lakes. The attempt to use one of their
specialised programs for one's own project resulted in many cases in
spending weeks of work for deciphering non-documented FORTRAN lines,
scattered with pre-historic fragments of code from more or, in some
cases, less talented programmers. Additional time had to be spend for
providing components for atmospheric forcing, etc, before the own
research project could finally be attacked.

<P>
To overcome these problems, the GOTM project was intiated, its
purpose being twofold. First, GOTM should provide an integrative
environment for all researchers interested in the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">application</SPAN>
of a turbulence model in studies of oceanic processes. Such a software
should contain a core part for solving transport equations of mean and
turbulent quantities, but equally well routines to compute the
atmosphere-ocean fluxes from meteorological or measured data,
including routines to interpolate and manipulate them. Second,
however, GOTM should also be a research tool for those interested in
the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">development</SPAN> of turbulence models and numerical
algorithms. This implies that GOTM should always contain the
state-of-the-art models and algorithms in these disciplines. The
current version of GOTM was developed under these premises.

<P>
In both cases, a detailed and comprehensible documentation is crucial,
and we spent a lot of effort to come close to this goal.  All methods
and models embedded in GOTM can be traced back to scientific
publications, a key requirement for the scientific use of a program.
Also, we took great care to make the FORTRAN95 code as safe, easily
understandable, and extensible, as possible.
