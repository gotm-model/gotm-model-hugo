# About GOTM

## History

GOTM (General Ocean Turbulence Model) development began in the mid-1990s as a tool for validating and comparing turbulence closure schemes for oceanic applications. Over three decades, it has evolved into a comprehensive framework used worldwide for:

- Ocean and lake process studies
- Turbulence model development and testing
- Biogeochemical modeling
- Integration into 3D circulation models
- Education and training

## Development Team

**Core Developers:**
- Hans Burchard (Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnemünde)
- Karsten Bolding (Bolding & Bruggeman)
- Lars Umlauf (Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnemünde)
- Jorn Bruggeman (National Oceanography Centre)

**Major Contributors:**
- Knut Klingbeil (Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnemünde)
- Qing Li (Los Alamos National Laboratory)
- And many others worldwide
