# Introduction to Turbulence Closure Models

### 5.1 The Closure Problem

Ocean and lake turbulence spans scales from millimeters (Kolmogorov) to hundreds of meters (basin). Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of all scales is computationally prohibitive. Instead, we use Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, decomposing variables into mean and fluctuating parts:

```
u = ū + u'    (velocity)
θ = θ̄ + θ'    (temperature)
```

Averaging introduces Reynolds stresses ⟨u'w'⟩ and scalar fluxes ⟨θ'w'⟩ as new unknowns. **Turbulence closure models** provide relationships between these fluxes and mean quantities, closing the system of equations.

### 5.2 Closure Hierarchy

**Zero-Equation Models:**
- Algebraic prescriptions for eddy viscosity
- Examples: Pacanowski-Philander, constant viscosity
- Pro: Simple, fast
- Con: No memory, cannot respond to transient forcing

**One-Equation Models:**
- Prognostic equation for turbulent kinetic energy (TKE)
- Length scale prescribed algebraically
- Pro: Responds to time-varying forcing
- Con: Length scale parameterization limits accuracy

**Two-Equation Models:**
- Prognostic equations for TKE and length-scale determining variable
- Examples: k-ε, k-ω, Mellor-Yamada 2.5, Generic Length Scale (GLS)
- Pro: Well-validated, efficient, physically consistent
- Con: Assumes local isotropy

**Second-Moment Closures:**
- Prognostic equations for all Reynolds stress components
- Examples: Full Mellor-Yamada, Kantha-Clayson
- Pro: Handles anisotropy, rotation
- Con: Computationally expensive, many empirical constants

GOTM specializes in **two-equation models** via the Generic Length Scale (GLS) framework, which unifies k-ε, k-ω, and Mellor-Yamada under one formulation.

### 5.3 Eddy Viscosity/Diffusivity

Most GOTM closures employ the eddy viscosity concept:

```
⟨u'w'⟩ = -νₜ ∂ū/∂z    (momentum flux)
⟨θ'w'⟩ = -κₜ ∂θ̄/∂z    (heat flux)
```

where νₜ (eddy viscosity) and κₜ (eddy diffusivity) are computed from:

```
νₜ = Sₘ L k^(1/2)
κₜ = Sₕ L k^(1/2)
```

Here:
- k = turbulent kinetic energy
- L = turbulent length scale
- Sₘ, Sₕ = stability functions (depend on stratification)

### 2.4 Key Physical Processes

**Shear Production (P):**
- Generated by velocity gradients: P = νₜ S²
- S² = (∂ū/∂z)² + (∂v̄/∂z)² (shear squared)
- Always positive (creates turbulence)

**Buoyancy Production (B):**
- Controlled by stratification: B = -g κₜ ∂ρ̄/∂z
- Negative in stable stratification (suppresses turbulence)
- Positive in unstable stratification (enhances turbulence, convection)

**Dissipation (ε):**
- Energy cascade to molecular scales: ε ∝ k^(3/2) / L
- Removes TKE from the system

**Richardson Number:**
```
Ri = N² / S²
```
where N² = -g/ρ₀ ∂ρ̄/∂z (buoyancy frequency squared)

- Ri << 1: Shear-dominated, strong mixing
- Ri ~ 0.25: Critical value for shear instability
- Ri >> 1: Stratification-dominated, weak mixing

### 2.5 Why Turbulence Matters

Vertical mixing controls:
- **Ocean**: Mixed layer depth, SST, air-sea fluxes, biological productivity, CO₂ uptake
- **Lakes**: Thermal structure, anoxia, nutrients, algal blooms, water quality
- **Estuaries**: Salinity intrusion, sediment dynamics, residence times

Errors in mixing propagate to ecosystem predictions, making turbulence closure critical.

### 2.6 GOTM's Approach

GOTM implements the **Generic Length Scale (GLS)** framework (Umlauf & Burchard, 2003), which unifies multiple two-equation models through parameters (p, m, n):

| Model | p | m | n | Second Variable |
|-------|---|---|---|-----------------|
| k-ε | 3.0 | 1.5 | -1.0 | Dissipation rate |
| k-ω | -1.0 | 0.5 | -1.0 | Specific dissipation |
| Mellor-Yamada | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | Length scale × TKE |
| Generic | 2.0 | 1.0 | -0.67 | Umlauf-Burchard |

This framework has been extensively validated and is used in many 3D ocean models.
